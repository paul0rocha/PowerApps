## Power Apps and Power Automate

### About this Project

The idea of â€‹â€‹the program is:

_"The project consists of obtaining stops from a robot and thus we have visibility of productivity losses during the day, after sending the report we set up a flow via power automate to convert the files from HTML to PDF and then send them to the supervision e-mails the same is recorded in an excel base."._

**PS:** We carried out the development to facilitate operational visibility for decision making by the management and supervision team to guarantee the separation processes.
